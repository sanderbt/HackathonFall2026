/**
 * Two things here are contracts with `unimicro plugin dev`, not preferences.
 *
 * `base` comes from UNIMICRO_ASSET_BASE. In proxy mode the platform loads this dev server's files through
 * the tunnel, under a path prefix it owns. Vite emits absolute URLs for anything it did not inline —
 * code-split chunks, `/@vite/client` — and those resolve against the platform's origin unless the
 * base says otherwise, at which point they leave the tunnel and 404.
 *
 * A build gets no prefix, because one artifact is served under a version path, the dev path and a
 * tunnel prefix. It defaults to relative, so assets resolve against the module the platform imported.
 *
 * UNIMICRO_DEV_ORIGIN is where the browser can reach this dev server without going through the tunnel, and
 * it is what makes HMR work. The HMR client is served through the tunnel, so by default it dials the
 * platform's origin, which has no socket for it. Pointed at this origin instead it connects straight
 * to the machine — a browser permits a `ws://localhost` socket even from an https page, because
 * loopback counts as a secure context.
